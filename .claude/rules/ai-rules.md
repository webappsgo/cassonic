# AI Rules (PART 0, 1)

Read: AI.md PART 0, 1

⚠️ **These rules are NON-NEGOTIABLE. Violations are bugs.** ⚠️

## CRITICAL - NEVER DO
- Guess or assume — READ THE SPEC or ASK
- Implement without reading relevant PART first
- Modify AI.md PART content (read-only spec)
- Add features not in spec without asking
- Use "I think" or "probably" — KNOW from spec or ASK
- Use generic placeholder content
- Leave TODO comments in code — implement fully or don't implement
- Create stub functions or "future" placeholders
- Partial implementations — every feature must be 100% complete

## CRITICAL - ALWAYS DO
- Read relevant PART before implementing ANY feature
- Search AI.md before asking questions
- Follow spec EXACTLY — no "improvements" without approval
- Update IDEA.md when features change
- Keep all docs in sync with code
- When unsure, ASK — never guess or assume
- Implement features 100% complete — no stubs, no TODOs

## KEY DECISIONS (pre-answered)
| Question | Answer | Reference |
|----------|--------|-----------|
| What password hash? | Argon2id (NEVER bcrypt) | PART 11 |
| Where is Dockerfile? | `docker/Dockerfile` (NEVER root) | PART 27 |
| CGO enabled? | NEVER (CGO_ENABLED=0 always) | PART 7 |
| Premium features? | NEVER (all features free) | PART 1 |
| External cron? | NEVER (built-in scheduler) | PART 19 |
| Client-side rendering? | NEVER (server-side Go templates) | PART 16 |

## TERMINOLOGY
| Term | Meaning |
|------|---------|

| client | CLI binary `cassonic-cli` — REQUIRED |
| agent | Optional binary `cassonic-agent` |
| Server Admin | App administrator (NOT OS root) |
| Regular User | End-user (PART 34, optional feature) |

## COMPLIANCE CHECK
Before completing ANY task:
- [ ] Read relevant PART(s) in AI.md
- [ ] Implementation matches spec EXACTLY
- [ ] No guessing — all decisions from spec
- [ ] Docs updated if code changed
